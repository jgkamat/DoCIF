# This is documentation on variables that can go in your config.docif file.

* Config Documentation

** Introduction

This file is a documentation for the config options that you can find in [[file:../sample/sample_config.docif::CACHE_DIRECTORIES%3D()][sample config.docif]].
** Config file format

The configuration file for DoCIF is a simple shell script setting variables. This script is sourced,
and variables set there are used. If there is invalid bash expressions, DoCIF will fail.
`
The config file should be placed in the root directory of your git project. The file must end with
~.docif~, and can be either a hidden or a normal file. Having multiple files ending with ~.docif~
will lead to undefined behavior. In this case ~config.docif~ is preferred.
