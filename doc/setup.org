# This is a docs page going over the basic setup of a DoCIF project.

* DoCIF Overview

DoCIF is the Docker Continuous Integration Framework.

Docker is a pretty cool technology, and it has enormous potential for making
testing much easier, but in practice, using docker is much harder than it sounds
for anything but the simplest setups. DoCIF aims to make setting up a new
project easier, both for newcomers and those who are seasoned docker testers!

Running testing in docker lets you:

1. Get the /exact/ build environment you want.
2. Ensure tests /always/ run in a clean environment (if you wish).
3. Allow saving state of any completed test so developers can reproduce an issue.
4. Cache images to the docker hub or your private registry (reducing dependency
   install times)
